# What is it about?
This is a sample project that uses the
[Spring Petclinic sample project](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) as a template to use the 
[usman-webstatic](https://github.com/vssavin/usman-webstatic). 
This project uses the [usman-webstatic-starter](https://github.com/vssavin/usman-webstatic-starter) dependency to
simplify configuration (automatic configuration for some beans).
